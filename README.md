## How to create a good Bug Report?

If your bug report is effective, chances are higher that it will get fixed. So fixing a bug depends on how effectively it's reported.

### 1) Reproducible:

If your bug is not reproducible it will never get fixed. You should clearly **provide the steps to reproduce the bug**. Do not assume or skip any reproducing step. A Step-by-step description of the issue is easy to reproduce and fix.

### 2) Be Specific

Do not write a essay about the problem. Be specific and to the point. Try to summarize the problem in minimum words yet in effective way. Donot combine multiple problems even they seem to be similar . Write different reports for each problem.

### 3) Environment Details:

Include the version of DeskDirector product you are using, the Operating System and the versions of the browser version. e.g. Web Portal, Windows 10, IE Edge 16, DeskDirector Server version 18.30.2.

* Operation System
* Browser Version
* Which product. (Web Portal, Desktop Portal, Web Tech)
