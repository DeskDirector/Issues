## How to create a good Bug Report?

If your bug report is effective, chances are higher that it will get fixed. So fixing a bug depends on how effectively it's reported.

### 1) Reproducible:

If your bug is not reproducible it will never get fixed. You should clearly **provide the steps to reproduce the bug**. Don't assume or skip any reproducing step. A step-by-step description of the issue is easy to reproduce and fix.

### 2) Be Specific

Don't write an essay about the problem, be specific and to the point. Try to summarize the problem in as few words as possible yet in an effective way. Don't combine multiple problems even they seem to be similar, write different reports for each problem.

### 3) Environment Details:

Include the version of the DeskDirector product you are using, the Operating System and the browser version. E.g. Web Portal, Windows 10, IE Edge 16, DeskDirector Server version 18.30.2.

* Operating System
* Browser Version
* DeskDirector product (Web Portal, Desktop Portal, Web Tech)
